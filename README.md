# Lua Additions

## About

### This library aims to provide a cross-platform replacement for Lua's standard library.
### Although this library is intended for cross-platform usage, it is ready to use (without modifications) inside of Roblox.
### Most of the methods in this library are directly inspired by the TC39 ECMAScript (JavaScript) standard.

## Example Usage for Roblox
### Currently we have not released a major version of this repository, therefore you must download the repository into a folder in your game called 'lua-additions'.
```lua
-- some script
local LA = require(game.Workspace:WaitForChild('lua-additions'):WaitForChild('MainModule'))
```
